# RFantibody Development Guide

## Commands
- Setup/install dependencies: `uv sync --all-extras` (installs all dependencies including test dependencies)
- Add a dependency: `uv add <package>`
- Run tests: `uv run python -m test.run_tests`
- Run a specific example: `bash scripts/examples/[path/to/example].sh`
- Docker build: `docker build -t rfantibody .`
- Docker run: `docker run --name rfantibody --gpus all -v .:/home --memory 10g -it rfantibody`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Python version: 3.10
- Imports: Standard library first, third-party packages second, local modules third
- Naming: Snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Documentation: Docstrings with descriptions of parameters and return values
- Error handling: Use try/except blocks with specific exception types
- File organization: Modular design with separate directories for components
- Testing: Deterministic tests with reference outputs for validation

## Development Notes
- The codebase primarily uses PyTorch for deep learning components
- RFantibody consists of three main modules: RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and RF2
- Quiver files (.qv) are used for storing multiple protein designs and scores
- Docker container is the recommended deployment environment

## Testing Infrastructure
- Tests require a supported GPU (A4000 or H100)
- Reference outputs are now organized by GPU type in the reference_outputs directory
- A4000-specific reference outputs are stored in reference_outputs/A4000_references
- H100-specific reference outputs are stored in reference_outputs/H100_references
- The test framework automatically detects GPU type and uses appropriate reference files

## Development Log
### 2026-07-03
- GPU-portability migration (support AMD ROCm, Intel XPU, and NVIDIA Blackwell/sm_120)
- Removed the DGL dependency entirely: added `se3_transformer/model/graph.py`, a lightweight `Graph` class plus native-PyTorch scatter reimplementations of the only DGL ops used (`copy_e_sum`, `copy_e_mean`, `e_dot_v`, `edge_softmax`, pooling). Verified bit-identical to DGL (forward + gradients) and identical full-model output
- The vendored SE3-Transformer has no custom CUDA kernels (pure PyTorch + DGL), so no kernel rewrite was needed
- Device abstraction: added `src/rfantibody/util/device.py` (`get_device`, device-agnostic `autocast`, `autocast_disabled` decorator, memory-stat dispatch) and `se3_transformer/model/profiling.py` (portable `nvtx_range`). Replaced hardcoded `cuda:0`, `torch.cuda.amp.autocast`, `torch.cuda.nvtx.range`, and `torch.cuda.{empty_cache,*_memory_*}` calls throughout the active inference path
- Bumped `torch==2.3.*` (cu118) to `torch==2.8.*` on the cu128 index for Blackwell support; removed unused torchaudio/torchvision; relaxed unused `cuda-python` to `>=12`. Bumped Docker/Apptainer base images to `nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-cudnn-devel-ubuntu22.04`
- Verified end-to-end on an RTX 5090 (sm_120): GPU forward matches CPU; all modules import under torch 2.8

### 2026-01-27
- Replaced USalign-based structural alignment with biotite's Kabsch superposition for RMSD calculations
- Simplified RMSD calculation workflow: now uses direct Cα superposition for same-length sequences
- Removed dependency on external USalign binary for routine RMSD calculations
- Added length-checking to gracefully skip RMSD calculations when input/output structures differ in length
- Changed DGL installation to use direct URL in pyproject.toml instead of wget download
- Removed include/setup.sh script in favor of direct `uv sync` commands
- Updated documentation to reflect simplified environment setup

### 2026-01-25
- Migrated from Poetry to uv for package management
- Converted pyproject.toml from [tool.poetry] to PEP 621 [project] format
- Updated Dockerfile to install uv instead of poetry
- Configured explicit PyTorch CUDA 11.8 index for torch packages
- Switched build backend from poetry to hatchling

### 2025-04-10
- Reorganized test input files into module-specific directories
- Created dedicated inputs_for_test directories for each test module
- Moved input files from shared example directories to module-specific locations
- Updated all test scripts to reference the new input paths
- Improved test modularity by keeping inputs closer to their test modules
- Separated test inputs from example inputs for clearer organization

### 2025-03-20
- Reorganized test reference outputs to support GPU-specific comparisons
- Added A4000_references directory for A4000 GPU reference outputs
- Added H100_references directory for H100 GPU reference outputs 
- Updated conftest.py to conditionally use GPU-specific reference files based on detected hardware
- Fixed run_test_suite.py to work with both A4000 and H100 GPUs
- Added isort to test dependencies for standardizing import formatting
- Added isort configuration in pyproject.toml to match code style guidelines
- Updated test infrastructure to use temporary directories for test outputs
- Added --keep-outputs flag to optionally preserve test outputs for inspection
- Optimized test output management: by default, tests now use automatically cleaned temporary directories, improving efficiency while still allowing output inspection when needed via the --keep-outputs flag
- Moved test outputs to module-specific output directories (test/rfdiffusion/example_outputs) for better organization
- Restructured test directory: moved RFdiffusion tests to test/rfdiffusion/ subdirectory to enable future test modules
- Implemented proper test module organization with __init__.py files and clear directory structure
- Updated path references in test scripts and runners to work with new directory structure
- Improved test output organization with module-specific example_outputs directories
- Added ProteinMPNN test module with deterministic test framework
- Implemented deterministic mode flag (-deterministic) in proteinmpnn_interface_design.py
- Created ab_seq_design.sh test script for ProteinMPNN with fixed random seeds and increased temperature
- Added RF2 test module with ab_prediction.sh test script
- Fixed RF2 model weight path in base.yaml to reference the correct model file
- Added seed parameter to RF2 prediction script for deterministic testing
- Updated run_tests.py to support multiple test modules (rfdiffusion, proteinmpnn, rf2)
- Added --module parameter to run_tests.py to selectively run specific test modules
- Added automated reference file generation for each supported GPU type
- Fixed issue with RF2 preprocessing when multiple input files are present
- Verified all test modules (rfdiffusion, proteinmpnn, rf2) run successfully
